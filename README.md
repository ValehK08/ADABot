# ADABot - Gemini & Multi-API Powered Discord Bot

ADABot is an advanced Discord bot integrating Google's Gemini AI for diverse functionalities. It features customizable AI response tones, file summarization (text, PDF, DOCX, images), AI image generation, news fetching & summarization, stock analysis, weather updates, horoscopes, meme generation, reminders, and social commands like roasting and complimenting. It utilizes a local SQLite database (`DataBase.db`) to store user information and message history for context-aware interactions.

Configure API Keys:
Open the Python script (e.g., adabot.py) and replace the placeholder strings with your actual API keys/tokens:

discord_token = "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
gemini = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
news_api = "YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"
openrouter = "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY" # Used for the !meme command's text generation

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note: For production or shared bots, it is highly recommended to use environment variables or a configuration file (.env) to store sensitive keys instead of hardcoding them directly in the script.

Discord Bot Permissions:
Ensure your Discord bot has the necessary Intents enabled in the Discord Developer Portal (especially Server Members Intent and Message Content Intent). It also needs appropriate permissions (like Read Messages, Send Messages, Attach Files, Embed Links, etc.) when you invite it to your server.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Execute the Python script:

python your_script_name.py # Replace 'your_script_name.py' with the actual filename
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy

üì¶ APIs Used

Discord API (via discord.py)

Google Gemini API (via google-generativeai) - For chat, summarization, image generation, analysis, etc.

NewsAPI (via newsapi-python & requests) - For fetching news headlines.

OpenRouter API (via requests) - For AI model access (!meme caption generation).

Imgflip API (via requests) - For meme template fetching and generation.

üóÉÔ∏è Data Handling

ADABot uses a local SQLite database file named DataBase.db to persist data:

users table: Stores basic information about server members (user_id, username, join_date). Populated when a member joins.

messages table: Logs messages sent in channels the bot can read (username, message, timestamp). This history is used to provide context for the !chat, !roast, and !compliment commands.

The database file is created automatically in the same directory as the script if it doesn't exist.
