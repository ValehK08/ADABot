    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ADABot.git
    cd ADABot
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment & install dependencies**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Insert your credentials**

    Open `bot.py` and replace:
    - `DISCORD_TOKEN` (optional if not self-hosting)
    - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (needed for chat/quote)
